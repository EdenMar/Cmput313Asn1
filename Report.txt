The simulation performed has been used to determine the impact that error-correction encoding has on the throughput of a communication channel. In our simulations, the value of K range from 0 to 5, for each value of e ranging from 0.001 to 0.009; all other variables remain constant. 

	At a value of K=0, no error-correction encoding is used. As K increases, a larger number of check bits are required to transmit each frame, however, more bad bits can be tolerated before having to retransmit the frame. 

	In our testing we found the optimal value of K to be to be K = ?? at a value of e = ??. As the Value of e increases, the optimal value for K does something probably, but we dont know what that is yet.

Dont need to generate actual messages, or implement actual bit corrections. Simply dealing with number of bits.



Given F, divide into K equal blocks
each block has num errors comutered and r bits added on for HSBC.
if 0 or 1 bit error:
	 block will be good
else:
	block will need retransmission

each transmission is worth A time units. 


asumptions:
	All Seeds are ints
	All args are ints or doubles
	incorrect number of args should cause program to terminate with error message
